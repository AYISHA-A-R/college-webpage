            <h2>The Brain Child</h2>
            <h1>of Dr. Thomas George</h1>
            <p>LEAD College of Management, Dhoni Palakkad is a brainchild of Dr. Thomas George, a professional life-skill trainer for various Engineering & MBA students in and around Kerala for years. Dr. Thomas’ training of students at various levels in a culture obsessed with measuring talent and ability opened his sense of creating an institution that gives importance to inspiration that might lead to entrepreneurship, social commitment, and values. According to him, inspiration awakens new possibilities by allowing one to transcend ordinary experiences and limitations. The idea of starting a business school in a three-tier city of Kerala got conceived, germinated, nourished, and became a reality in 2011.</p>
